# ClimateHealth
Repository for Climate Health Workflow

The high level goal of this workflow is the integration of multi-scale satellite imagery for agricultural decision making with respect to Climate forecasting. 
In this initial phase there are two projects foreseen: 1) the integration of satellite information from gravity probing of ground water capacities, far-infrared imaging of CO2 emissions, and multi-spectral imaging of vegetation and pollution and 2) the introduction of ground sensors of CO2 levels and bee hive health as surrogate ground sensors of local environmental health and diversity. 
The project will engage the Model and Data Catalogue insofar as these use cases help to guide the development of the model and data integration infrastructure.  As new sensors arrive into the pallette of availability, they will serve to demonstrate the suggestion power of the catalogue as an active suggestion engine for matching related datasets and models.

## Bee Project (APIary) Overlap
Longer ramp up, this use case will also exercise the model catalogue as the information encoding used for in the APIary workflow is being designed for compatability with the datacenter acoustics and the tokamak fusion use cases.
